# K-th Root Calculator

This C program calculates the k-th root of a number \( x \) with specified precision \( e \). Developed during my programming course, the program implements the Newton-Raphson method to find the root.

## Features

- Input the number \( x \) for which you want to find the root.
- Specify the index \( k \) of the root (e.g., 2 for square root, 3 for cube root).
- Set the desired precision \( e \).
- Validate inputs to ensure valid calculations.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the ropository:
  ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/NVDIV/RootCalculator.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd RootCalculator
```
3. Compile the program:
  ```bash
  gcc -o root root.c
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
./root
```

## How to Use

Enter the value of x (the number to find the root of).
Enter the value of k (the index of the root).
Enter the precision e (in the format of 0.001).
The program will calculate and display the k-th root of the number.
